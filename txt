Python:

Source Code → Bytecode → Interpreter (Executes bytecode line-by-line) slower


Java:

Source Code → Bytecode → JVM with JIT Compiler (Compiles bytecode to machine code) faster

Python (and many other programming languages), == is used to compare the values of two variables or expressions to check if they are equal.

In Python, the is keyword is used to compare the references or identities of two objects, rather than their values.

Built-in Namespace: Contains names that are built into Python, such as functions like print() and len(). This namespace is available in any Python environment.

List comprehensions in Python are a concise way to create lists. 
numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(numbers)  # Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

args means positional argument while kwargs means key = 10 like this
